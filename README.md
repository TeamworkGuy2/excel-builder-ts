TypeScript Excel-Builder
==============

TypeScript port of the [excel-builder.js](https://github.com/stephenliberty/excel-builder.js) Library - 'A way to build excel files with javascript'.

The project has been re-organized into sub-folders since it was ported. Some documentation and minor field and variable tweaks have been made to work better with TypeScript.

The eventual goal is for [xlsx-spec-models](https://github.com/TeamworkGuy2/xlsx-spec-models) and [xlsx-spec-utils](https://github.com/TeamworkGuy2/xlsx-spec-utils) to replace this project.
